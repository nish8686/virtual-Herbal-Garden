            The Virtual Herbal Garden for <b>AYUSH </b> is a digital initiative designed to showcase India’s vast and valuable <br> 
            heritage of medicinal plants. Rooted in the traditional knowledge systems of <u> Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, and <br>
            Homeopathy (AYUSH)</u>  , our platform makes centuries-old wisdom accessible to everyone through modern technology. <br>
<br>
            We believe that nature holds solutions for health, wellness, and sustainable living. Our mission is to create <br>
            an interactive, educational, and easy-to-use platform where users can explore detailed information about <br>
            medicinal plants—their identification, benefits, uses, and cultural significance. <br><br>

            <b>Our platform features:</b> <br><br>

            1) Interactive Plant Cards with authentic details, uses, and precautions. <br>

            2) Search and Filter Options to find plants by name, category, or health benefit. <br>

            3) Multilingual Support to reach audiences across India. <br><br>

            <b>By bridging the gap between ancient herbal knowledge and modern digital tools, we aim to:</b> <br><br>

            1) Educate the public on the benefits of natural remedies. <br>

            2) Support farmers, herbal product manufacturers, and AYUSH practitioners. <br>

            3) Preserve India’s biodiversity by encouraging awareness and cultivation of medicinal plants. <br><br>

            This project is not just an app — it’s a step towards reviving traditional health practices in a <br>
            way that fits the lifestyle of today’s generation.
